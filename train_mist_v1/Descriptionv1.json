For example, a group of people smoking in a bar is unusual because smoking is no longer common in public places. Similarly, seeing people holding drinks or wine glasses in a hotel room could be seen as unusual because it is unlikely that people would be drinking alcohol in a public setting like a hotel. Finally, a person holding a drink in a red shirt and talking on a cell phone could be considered unusual because it is a rare sight to see people socializing and conversing with someone on a cell phone while also consuming alcohol.",

The presence of a gun in a bar setting is a clear indication of a potentially dangerous or unsettling situation, and it is not something that one would typically witness in everyday life.",
