During this time, we see a hippo swimming in the water and walking across it multiple times, accompanied by other animals. However, there are some unusual features that stand out. Firstly, the hippo's movement is not natural. Instead of swimming in a fluid motion like other animals in the video, it appears to be moving in a robotic, awkward way, almost as if it is being controlled by an external force. Secondly, the hippo's skin appears to be a darker color than the other animals in the video, giving it an almost grayish hue. Lastly, the hippo's movements are not synchronized with the other animals in the video. While the other animals seem to be moving in a natural way based on their surroundings, the hippo's movements appear to be forced and unnatural, which makes the scene quite unusual and intriguing.\nA: In the video, a man is riding a horse and shooting a gun at a large elephant. The elephant is running away from the man, and the scene appears to be a tense and dangerous encounter. The man's actions are unusual, as it is not common for people to engage in a firefight with an elephant, especially while riding a horse.

Furthermore, the video is shot at night, which is also a rare time for cars to be parked on the street. This is an unusual situation, and the anomaly lies in the combination of these factors.\nA: The anomalous segment in the video is a scene where a man is walking on the road while a truck is driving down the street. This is not a common sight, as pedestrians are usually not allowed to walk on the road. The man is walking in front of the truck, which is a potential hazard for both the pedestrian and the driver.
